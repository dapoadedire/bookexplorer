# BooksExplorer

A React-based application that allows users to search for books, view book details, and track their search history. The application is built using a variety of technologies such as React, React Router, @tanstack/react-query, HTML React Parser, ESLint, Prettier, Vite, and Font Awesome.

## Tech Stack
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Router: A library for routing in React applications
- @tanstack/react-query: A library that allows for the management of asynchronous data in React applications
- HTML React Parser: A library that allows the parsing of HTML strings and renders them as React components
- ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and re-printing it
- Vite: A development server that enables fast development by using native ES modules in the browser
- Font Awesome: A library that provides scalable vector icons that can be easily customized (size, color, drop shadow, etc.)

## Lessons Learned
- Routing in React: This project allowed for the practice of routing in a React application using React Router.
- Managing asynchronous data in React: The @tanstack/react-query library was utilized to manage asynchronous data in the application.
- Parsing and displaying HTML in React: The HTML React Parser library was utilized to parse and display HTML strings as React components.
- Implementing a search feature: The application includes a search feature that allows users to search for books and view book details.
- Using Vite as development server and building tool: Vite was used as the development server and building tool for this project, allowing for fast development and easy building.
- Styling with CSS: Basic CSS was used throughout the project for styling.
